<p>DISCLAIMER_STATEMENT</p>
<hr>
<p>In <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/inconvenient_statements/" target="_blank">INCONVENIENT_STATEMENTS</a>, I published some statements which I knew might upset some readers due to the fact that I unapologitically expressed that I would choose to vaporize parents and their children in order to save the environment and those who I would want to share the planet with (using the fictional, featureless character R to speak on my behalf rather than to just &#8220;own&#8221; my own words by not having to invent imaginary characters which I hide behind) if I thought that the human species would go extinct otherwise (because it is &#8220;better&#8221; to delete some of the humans instead of all of them because those who remain would get the chance to continue not squandering the opportunity to exist and eventually thrive).</p>
<p>By vaporize, I meant (and still mean) to instantaneously and painlessly as possible get rid of a body with no visible trace of that body remaining.</p>
<p>Do I still stand by what I said in INCONVENIENT_STATEMENTS?</p>
<p>While it would be convenient to laugh and dismiss that piece as mere satire while I hear the good news that <span style="background:#ffff00;">all the automobiles on the road are going to swiftly be replaced by solar-powered, self-driving, and inexpensive automobiles which transport passengers via some kind of taxi service</span> (and that all meat would no longer be derived from sentient animals but, instead, grown from stem cells in laboratories and distributed to all grocery stores and restaurants (and that all pollutionary forms of generating electricity would be banned and replaced entirely by renewable energy sources (and that farms would stop using pesticides on crops in favor of non-toxic alternatives to keeping food crops safe from diseases and pests (and human civilization is rapidly hurtling towards its goal of utopia without ever slowing down and even while never having to reach that necessarily &#8220;too idealistic to be manifested&#8221; vision)))), the answer is no. I would rather kill myself than commit genocide.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">(For humans who &#8220;need&#8221; to drive in order to feel good about their lives, I recommend go-cart arenas for the same reason I would recommend that violence-prone people channel their sadistic instincts into violent forms of artwork (especially video games)).</span></p>
<p>Honestly, I think there is ample evidence to support the prediction that humans will eventually reverse the ecological damage which the species has done and that the rates of population growth and decay will reach a sustainable equilibrium (and that people who want to make babies will have the option to deploy artificial wombs, genetic customization, and gametes manufactured from stem cells instead of deploying the disgustingly brutal and impractical traditional means of procreation which involves impregnating a female human adult and causing that female human adult (and frequently its offspring, et cetera) to suffer unnecessary degrees of suffering).</p>
<p>If I had my way, all human beings would be sterilized and all generation of new humans will be implemented by artificially intelligent machines which calibrate the output of new &#8220;genetically perfect&#8221; humans to accommodate the current and predicted planetary ecosystem. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Yes, I am a technocrat who believes that machines should (and probably will) replace human authorities and perform 99% of all necessary societal labor (so that humans can be free to either evolve as cyborgs or die quick and painless deaths as mere apes (and the last of their kind (since humanity literally needs to become a new species in order to survive what it currently cannot))).</span></p>
<p>Perhaps I should have made a splash page that requires site visitors to be at least 21 years of age to &#8220;legally&#8221; click on any of the page links of this website. Perhaps I should put big bold red letters on the front page which say, <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff0000;">THIS WEBSITE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!&#8221;</strong>. I do not want to ruin the aesthetic I am trying to uphold, however. I do not want to call excessive attention to what I personally find whore-some (and not wholesome), ugly, and detrimental to the net well-being of Earth&#8217;s biosphere: kids having kids and expecting to be treated like kids as a result.</p>
