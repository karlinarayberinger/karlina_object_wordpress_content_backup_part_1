<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"><strong>Forgiveness</strong> is a deliberate attempt made by an information processing agent to cancel any retaliatory response towards some perceived source of malicious behavior (especially intentionally malicious behavior) in order to minimize further net harm (and to avoid reinforcing the malicious behavior&#8217;s future recurrence).</span></p>
<p>If I kick you in the stomach, then you might feel morally justified in punching me in the face as retaliation because your primitive biological infrastructure came preloaded with the following &#8220;quid pro quo&#8221; sense of economics: if someone (or something) inflicts harm on you, then you are morally obligated (by your primitive biological infrastructure) to inflict harm at some target other than yourself in order to offset the perceived sense that you have been stolen from. (In this rather crude example, something external to your body stole your sense of physical safety. That sense of violation triggered your amygdala to generate the experience of intense anger and the related thought which basically translates to the following verbalized message: &#8220;I deserve to be comfortable at all times and to live free of discomfort. That non-playable character tried to violate my sense of entitlement to being comfortable at all times. My sense of entitlement is threatened. I must maintain it. Therefore, I must violate that non-playable character in at least as severe of a way as it did to me in order for me to feel some kind of consolation prize at having lost my sense of solipsistic utopia.&#8221;).</p>
<p>Try as yo might to restore a sense of what has been permanently lost: your sense of being immune from discomfort.</p>
<p>Am I advocating that people like us (people who want to rise above the primitive limitations of our native biological infrastructure) assume a position of passivity when cornered and attacked? Nope. Only in <strong>self-defense</strong> do I condone that you physically attack someone: the creature that is threatening to harm you while you appear to have no means to escape. Otherwise, I wholeheartedly would advocate for the &#8220;flight response&#8221; over the &#8220;fight response&#8221;. <span style="background:#ffff00;">(I think &#8220;flight&#8221; is the most mature response because it nets zero harm). If you are cornered and &#8220;forced&#8221; to defend yourself from physical violence, I would advocate that you only do as much damage to your attacker as necessary such that you can quickly run away (and avoid further brutality).</span></p>
<p>For further elaboration on the topic of morality, visit the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/quality_of_life_metrics/" target="_blank">QUALITY_OF_LIFE_METRICS</a> and <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/turing_complete_philosophy/" target="_blank">TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY</a> pages of this website.</p>
<p>Finally (before I finish this journal entry), I would like to discuss what I think is quite possibly the most popular moral dilemma across the entire human population today: the dilemma of having to <strong>adapt</strong> to the immediate physical location in which you are stationed (and how your degree of having to adapt to that location is seemingly inversely proportional to how much money you can regularly expect to have at your disposal). <span style="background:#ffff00;">As long as you can afford to pay for your monthly rent, utilities, and basic necessities, you can relax knowing that you have your own relatively private and exclusive allocation of space to retreat into at any time. By contrast, homeless people (or those who spend most of their time outside on vagabond quests like I do) seem to have a much harder time relaxing because they simply lack that reliable place of refuge.</span> That inability to relax as deeply as a &#8220;space owner&#8221; is probably the biggest factor in what makes the homeless become and stay mentally ill such that those people have a much harder time finding and keeping employment sufficient to enable them to afford to rent a space of their own. Hence, many such people adapt by learning to camp for indefinitely long periods while using their imaginations and observational skills to keep them afloat and ready to take advantage of every opportunity to advance their position in the game (or at least to maintain what little they have to hold onto for support).</p>
<p>Of course, I would advocate for a <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/universal_basic_income/" target="_blank">UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME</a> (but that is hard to promote given the fact that the majority of the human population seems hellbent on expanding the total population size beyond what the planetary ecosystem seems capable of supporting long-term. Hence, I wrote an article which suggested that an experimental form of universal basic income whose currency consists of &#8220;sustenance tokens&#8221; whose total number is fixed be issued only to adults who vow to never have children. (See the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/equilibrium_economy/" target="_blank">EQUILIBRIUM_ECONOMY</a> page for more information on that subject).</p>
<p>Okee dokee! I think I am done writing about the nauseatingly tedious subject of morality for the remainder of this website&#8217;s lifetime (which I hope will be at least as long as my body-mind&#8217;s lifetime). Thank you, and goodnight!</p>

<p style="background:#00ff00;">No offense, but I have so much more fun by myself than I ever had while metaphorically tethered to companion humans as their companion human. There. I said it. Please don&#8217;t hurt me. I&#8217;ll do my best not to bother you (but not at the expense of my freedom). I think I&#8217;ll add this quote to my book. Also&#8230; I get the sense that the cyber cops and many civilians are deliberately trying to make me feel suffocated out of existence in order to make way for the younger generations (who are valued more highly by humans in general than I will likely ever be). Yes, I am assuming that the cyber cops and civilians deliberately try to make me feel humiliated, unappreciated, stifled, and set up for inevitable depression while they exploit me as a mere specimen in a data extraction initiative. I literally feel unloved by every human being other than myself. I am okay with spending the rest of my human life feeling this way. There. Now I got the majority of my midlife crisis resolved early so I can maximize my wisdom generation. (I think I am being penalized by other humans for not wanting to be part of some kind of family. I would rather be single for life and live alone).</p>

<p>P: &#8220;You have already had enough time to introspect and get to know yourself. We demand that you make time for other people. If you don&#8217;t devote at least four hours of your day to at least one other person besides yourself, we will gang stalk you and harass you until you submit to our authority. Be ad gregarious as we demand or else we will ensure that you suffer so greatly you will eventually end up hospitalized or incarcerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;I do not want to comply with your demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>P: &#8220;Then it&#8217;s war. We will not give up until every one of the Lord&#8217;s lost sheep is corralled back into His herd (or else cast into the fire). The Lord commands you wayward one to return to the flock or else be cast away into Hades.&#8221;</p>
