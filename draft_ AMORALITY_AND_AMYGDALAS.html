To make an otherwise detailed story comparatively succinct, I am just now starting to personally understand the importance of not "acting white" in the region I am currently too economically destitute to leave.

"Acting white" is when any person flaunts its apparently expensive academic background to an audience of persons who apparently have been involuntarily prevented from attaining such an academic background (especially where such academic prowess in apparently unnecessary). 

The opposite of "acting white" is being humble, sycophantic, and nonchalant about matters other than caring for one's own circle of friends, colleagues, household members, and relatives. 

Apparently, I need to minimize how much I "act white" offline in order to ingratiate myself to those who might give me food, money, and other economic resources I want (and need). Otherwise, the locals will dismiss me as presumably too wealthy and too well-supported at whatever Nazi mansion I am presumably an eternally cherished member of.

Although intelligence does not always correlate with economic affluence, it usually almost always done in traditional human civilization.
