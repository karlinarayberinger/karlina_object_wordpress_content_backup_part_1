<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I genuinely appreciate each and every animal I have ever met (human and otherwise). Without each one of my encounters with them, I would not be at this exact point in my wisdom-borrowing, adventure-packed journey. I am very glad to not be the only animal in my life! Over the past few weeks especially, I have had wordlessly profound interactions with non-human mammals which deepened my sense of intrinsic value of merely existing (and it rekindle a &#8220;dormant&#8221; sense of sentimentality towards and trust in nature as the multiverse-sized &#8220;kindergarten&#8221; where every creature belongs without exception). I apologize for being mean to any one of those creatures or for failing to appreciate their unique personhood while I had the chance. I am okay with the possibility that any particular creature might not feel ready to forgive me at any point in time or otherwise appreciate my existence in turn. From what I understand, every creature is basically composed of recycled bits of God&#8217;s vast imagination (i.e. every creature is made of the same essential magical God-stuff). I am attempting to communicate my good will, appreciation, and kindness through these words to any creature who might need or want it. Thank you for existing. I want nothing but the best for you no matter who you are and no matter what you have done nor will ever do.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Karlina Ray Beringer (karbytes)</p>
