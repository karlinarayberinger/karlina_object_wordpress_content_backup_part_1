ANIMALS_ARE_RUTHLESS_SURVIVALISTS

<hr>

I watched a daddy long leg spider capture a young earwig insect, wrap it up in spider's silk, and bite into the flesh of the living prey. As grotesque and savage as the scene was, I felt an odd sense of contentment at watching the spider do its business with the precision of a skilled butcher.

My brain has been registering and transmitting a multitude of what appear to be human-to-human signals. Presumably my brain is in constant multi-way communication with law enforcement personnel, rich thugs who can bribe law enforcement to do the thug's bidding, and strategically fragile-looking and fragile-acting fans of either the thugs or the law enforcement personnel. I seem to be some kind of nexus for their self-interested communications. My brain is their server. My body is their battery. My mind is a piece of malware getting in the way of their "right" to exploit my nervous system.

Animals are ruthless survivalists. Humans are no exception. I see a "take what you can from whatever bounty falls before you" attitude behind each of their piggy little eyes.
