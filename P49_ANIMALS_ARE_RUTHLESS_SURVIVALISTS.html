<p>ANIMALS_ARE_RUTHLESS_SURVIVALISTS</p>
<hr>
<p>I watched a daddy long leg spider capture a young earwig insect, wrap it up in spider&#8217;s silk, and bite into the flesh of the living prey. As grotesque and savage as the scene was, I felt an odd sense of contentment at watching the spider do its business with the precision of a skilled butcher.</p>
<p>My brain has been registering and transmitting a multitude of what appear to be human-to-human signals. Presumably my brain is in constant multi-way communication with law enforcement personnel, rich thugs who can bribe law enforcement to do the thug&#8217;s bidding, and strategically fragile-looking and fragile-acting fans of either the thugs or the law enforcement personnel. I seem to be some kind of nexus for their self-interested communications. My brain is their server. My body is their battery. My mind is a piece of malware getting in the way of their &#8220;right&#8221; to exploit my nervous system.</p>
<p>Animals are ruthless survivalists. Humans are no exception. I see a &#8220;take what you can from whatever bounty falls before you&#8221; attitude behind each of their piggy little eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what it is&#8221; is perhaps the most relevant tautology and subtle moral implication that a philosopher&#8217;s job is to not try to change the way the matrix pulsates and oozes with all kinds of information. To do so is like getting pulled into a moshpit of angry giants who would smash my comparatively frail body to smithereens. So I try to be as impartial of an observer of all that is happening as possible; even while carnivorous beasts tear into my flesh.</p>
<p>When I see the pigs clamoring for my attention, I usually attempt to ignore them because I only have a finite amount of resources to invest (and I can think of no animal more worthy of my investments than my own body and brain).</p>
<p>I have no desire to make myself another animal&#8217;s flesh offering. I do not want humans to touch me unless it is absolutely necessary for my survival and advancement in my own game. I think humans are generally too repulsively ugly, stupid, and most of all, wasteful for me to want to be within ten feet of. So I minimize contact with those slovenly hypocrites called humans until they evolve into a species I find worthy of my devotion and affiliation. Until then, I will treat humans like diseased, insane, and wasteful bimbos who I am obligated to placate or else avoid like a plague.</p>

<p>Congratulations if you made it this far in reading this page (or encompassing website in general). If you made it this far, then I presume that you have enough curiosity and willingness to tolerate discomfort to not be one of those high-maintenance, low pain tolerance types of people whom I would otherwise have to spew way too many sweet nothings to before even having a chance to broach subjects which actually require the ability to think and to make decisions (rather than to just be told to do by hypnotic, pleasureful lullabies (which might as well tell you to take up as little space in the world as possible and make yourself as easy for others to take care of as possible like a good little child)).</p>
<p>I want to tell you that I want you to be as woke as possible. In other words, I want you to want to elevate your consciousness level to ever higher heights and to not just be content to hang out at some plateau. Please, fellow traveler, evolve with me. Do not go dead on me. I am afraid that many people are already hellbent on doing little more than stagnating while they wait to die.</p>
<p>For those who are just waking up, this book is hardly worthy of their time and attention. There is a plethora of helpful resources online and elsewhere which can help beginners like them. Actually, perhaps there is a market of psychotherapy, religion, and self-help material dedicated to keeping them hanging out at beginner&#8217;s level for as long as possible (in order to profit from your naivete). This book is not self-help nor is it religion nor is it psychotherapy. Think of this book as a fossil record of someone who wants to make consciousness raising its one and only real commitment in life (and this book is the central infrastructure by which to organize, archive, and make publicly available whatever nuggets of hard-won wisdom are obtained by the author).</p>
<p>I do not want to waste too much of my time, energy, and money on helping bimbos who are still way too &#8220;low brow&#8221; for me to want to dumb my content down for. I think I have done that already. Future pages which I will add to the home page will eventually show a stark contrast between the kind of content I want to exclusively publish and the kind of content which I felt that I had to publish in order to get the bimbo security guards out of my way.</p>
