ANIMALS_ARE_RUTHLESS_SURVIVALISTS

<hr>

I watched a daddy long leg spider capture a young earwig insect, wrap it up in spider's silk, and bite into the flesh of the living prey. As grotesque and savage as the scene was, I felt an odd sense of contentment at watching the spider do its business with the precision of a skilled butcher.

My brain has been registering and transmitting a multitude of what appear to be human-to-human signals. Presumably my brain is in constant multi-way communication with law enforcement personnel, rich thugs who can bribe law enforcement to do the thug's bidding, and strategically fragile-looking and fragile-acting fans of either the thugs or the law enforcement personnel. I seem to be some kind of nexus for their self-interested communications. My brain is their server. My body is their battery. My mind is a piece of malware getting in the way of their "right" to exploit my nervous system.

Animals are ruthless survivalists. Humans are no exception. I see a "take what you can from whatever bounty falls before you" attitude behind each of their piggy little eyes.

"It is what it is" is perhaps the most relevant tautology and subtle moral implication that a philosopher's job is to not try to change the way the matrix pulsates and oozes with all kinds of information. To do so is like getting pulled into a moshpit of angry giants who would smash my comparatively frail body to smitheines. So I try to be as impartial of an observer of all that is happening as possible; even while carnivorous beasts tear into my flesh.

When I see the pigs clamoring for my attention, I usually attempt to ignore them because I only have a finite amount of resources to invest (and I can think of no animal more worthy of my investments than my own body and brain).
