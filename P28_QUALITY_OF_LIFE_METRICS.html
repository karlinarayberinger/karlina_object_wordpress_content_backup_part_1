<p>QUALITY_OF_LIFE_METRICS</p>
<hr>
<p>In <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/survival/" target="_blank">SURVIVAL</a>, I sloppily attempted to communicate my (outdated) opinion that suicide is the only moral way for a person to die and that striving for immortality is the only moral way for a person to live. (As of now, that opinion is obsolete because my personal standards of morality have evolved).</p>
<p>In this page, I want to posit that a life worth living is one which is determined by its inhabitant to generate more pleasure than suffering (both as an &#8220;amplitude&#8221; metric and as a &#8220;frequency&#8221; metric).</p>
<p>Of course, minimally satisfying suffering-to-pleasure ratios for both metrics will vary from one person to another (since each person is a repository of unique experiences).</p>
<p>By &#8220;amplitude&#8221;, I mean intensity of the affect of an experience which is either predominantly suffering or else predominantly pleasure (while excluding half-and-half combinations as a subjective experiential category).</p>
<p>By &#8220;frequency&#8221;, I mean intensity the number of times a sufficiently intense experience which is either predominantly suffering or else predominantly pleasure occurs within a particular interval of time.</p>
