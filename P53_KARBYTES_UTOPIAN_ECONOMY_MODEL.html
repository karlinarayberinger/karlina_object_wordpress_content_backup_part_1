The following terms represent the variable components of an idealistic (yet feasible to implement) economy which would

(a) conserve the value of a single unit of monetary currency (by making the total number of tokens directly proportional to the total population size), 

(b) enable each citizen to subsist on a universal basic income (by creating two type of non-overlapping currencies such that one type of currency (i.e. SUSTENANCE_TOKEN) will be exclusively used for purchasing "basic necessities" and the other type of currency (i.e. SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN) will be exclusively used for "luxury" transactions), 

(c) reward citizens for doing more than merely taking care of one's own basic survival and comfort (by issuing SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN instances to citizens who participate in contract work, social media participation, sports participation, publishing artwork, winning lotteries, et cetera), 

(d) prevent the stagnation of essential monetary flow (by requiring that all SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances be spent within a scheduled time period), and 

(e) eliminate significant gaps between the wealthiest citizens and the poorest citizens (by requiring that all SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances be spent within a scheduled time period).

<strong>SUSTENANCE_TOKEN:</strong> an indivisible unit of monetary currency which is only allowed to be spent on basic living expenses such as food, rent, inexpensive clothing, utilities (e.g. Internet connection, electricity, drinkable tap water, phone connectivity), transportation (especially solar-powered, self-driving taxis, trains, ferries, submarines, and aircrafts), health care (including psychotherapy, psychiatry, holistic exercise classes, and rehabilitation services), undergraduate-level college education, employment training, and employment-related gear (e.g. phone, laptop computer, basic electronics accessories).

Note: In order to eliminate the fluctuation of the value of a single SUSTENANCE_TOKEN, the total number of SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances which are instantiated at TIME_T is directly proportional to the number of citizens at TIME_T. In other words, as the total population of citizens increases by exactly one citizen, exactly N SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances will be generated in the economy database. Likewise, as the total population of citizens decreases by exactly one citizen, exactly N SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances will be deleted from the economy database (and N is exactly one specific natural number quantity).

Note: On the first day of each month, each citizen's personal SUSTENANCE_TOKEN bank account will (a) have any unspent tokens withdrawn and (b) immediately reimbursed with a fixed monthly maximum amount (which is the same number for each citizen; a number which is derived by dividing N by the total number of citizens).

<hr>

<strong>SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN:</strong> an indivisible unit of monetary currency which is only allowed to be spent on items other than what SUSTENANCE_TOKEN instances are spent on (and only allowed to be aquired via working contract jobs, donations, prostitution, or gambling).

Note: In order to eliminate the fluctuation of the value of a single SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN, the total number of SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN instances which are instantiated at TIME_T is directly proportional to the number of citizens at TIME_T. In other words, as the total population of citizens increases by exactly one citizen, exactly P SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN instances will be generated in the economy database. Likewise, as the total population of citizens decreases by exactly one citizen, exactly P SUPPLEMENTARY_TOKEN instances will be deleted from the economy database (and P is exactly one specific natural number quantity).
