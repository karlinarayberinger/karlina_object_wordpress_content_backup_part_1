KARBYTES_UTOPIAN_ECONOMY_MODEL

<hr>

The following terms represent the variable components of an idealistic (yet feasible to implement) economy which would

(a) conserve the value of a single unit of monetary currency, 

(b) enable each citizen to subsist on a universal basic income (regardless of how much that citizen earns from working in exchange for money or else from receiving monetary donations), 

(c) earn additional monetary income through contract jobs (i.e. jobs which are designed to be completed within a finite amount of time and to the satisfaction of the employer such that minimal time, energy, and material resources are wasted), 

(d) prevent the stagnation of monetary flow (by requiring that all money be spent within a scheduled time period), and 

(e) eliminate significant gaps between the wealthiest citizens and the poorest citizens (by not allowing any one person to hoard money for any longer than the scheduled time period in which that money can either be stored or else transferred to another person).

<strong>SUSTENANCE_TOKEN:</strong> an indivisible unit of monetary currency which is only allowed to be spent on basic living expenses such as food, rent, inexpensive clothing, utilities (e.g. Internet connection, electricity, drinkable tap water, phone connectivity), transportation (especially solar-powered, self-driving taxis, trains, ferries, submarines, and aircrafts), health care (including psychotherapy, psychiatry, holistic exercise classes, and rehabilitation services), undergraduate-level college education, employment training, and employment-related gear (e.g. phone, laptop computer, basic electronics accessories).

Note: In order to eliminate the fluctuation of the value of a single SUSTENANCE_TOKEN, the number of SUSTENANCE_TOKEN objects which are instantiated at TIME_T are directly proportional to the number of citizens at TIME_T.
