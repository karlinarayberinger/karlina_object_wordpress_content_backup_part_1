KARBYTES_UTOPIAN_ECONOMY_MODEL

<hr>

The following terms represent the variable components of an idealistic (yet feasible to implement) economy which would

(a) conserve the value of a single unit of monetary currency (and thereby eliminate the need to add or to remove monetary tokens from the economy in order to "compensate" for the fluctuating monetary worth of a single monetary token), 

(b) enable each citizen to subsist on a universal basic income (regardless of how much that citizen earns from working in exchange for money or else from receiving monetary donations), 

(c) earn additional monetary income through contract jobs (i.e. jobs which are designed to be completed within a finite amount of time and to the satisfaction of the employer such that minimal time, energy, and material resources are wasted), 

(d) prevent the stagnation of monetary flow (by requiring that all money be spent within a scheduled time period), and 

(e) eliminate significant gaps between the wealthiest citizens and the poorest citizens (by not allowing any one person to hoard money for any longer than the scheduled time period in which that money can either be stored or else transferred to another person).
