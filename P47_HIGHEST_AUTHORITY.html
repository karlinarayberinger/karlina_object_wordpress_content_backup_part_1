<p>To Myself (and To Whom Ever Else It May Concern):</p>
<p>I am using the last of the early morning dawn before the humans become distracting to me to write this &#8220;final orange note&#8221; before I go off and do whatever my intuition tells me to do. It is clear to me now that (almost certainly) no one except for me values my time and happiness even a fraction as much as I do (and that will likely always be the case until humans evolve to the extent that they can genuinely value egos as much as their own native individual ego). Therefore, asking other people for advice is almost always a waste of my time since I almost always seem to have the means and the ability to answer my own questions with minimal assistance. I am disgusted beyond words at how humans have been conditioned to wait for some other person to give them permission to actually tap into their own abilities. All I want to do is be as autonomous and harmless as possible. I do not want to be a teacher because I do not want to make a profit off of other people&#8217;s ignorance (especially when most forms of education could be outsourced to artificially intelligent assistants and the student working as its own teacher of its own custom curriculum). I also do not want to be a therapy animal for other people to use for their own gratification. I am not content to play idiotic games of fetch with sadistic and/or stupid simpletons who do not seem to share my values in life. This is not a love letter. <span style="background:#ffff00;">This is a reminder to myself to remain my own highest authority.</span> No matter how long it takes for me to get a satisfying career, I am willing to move at my own pace even while other people complain and torture me for not moving at the pace they want me to (and to dance the kind of dance they want me to dance).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
