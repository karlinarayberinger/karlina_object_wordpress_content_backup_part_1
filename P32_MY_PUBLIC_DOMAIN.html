MY_PLUBLIC_DOMAIN

<hr>

In <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>, I drafted and published my own definition of "public source". In this page, my goal is to elaborate on what I wrote in that older page; not to replace what I wrote in that older page.

<strong>MY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN</strong> consists of all the content displayed in each one of the repositories which are displayed on my primary GitHub account (<a href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank">https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/</a>) and all of the content on all of the pages of this website (<a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a>).

Note: The only code repositories on the aforementioned GitHub profile (username: karlinarayberinger) are public rather than private. A <strong>public</strong> repository is allegedly visible to any person with an Internet connection and who uses that Internet connection to visit that respository at any time during that repository's lifetime using a web browser application. By contrast, a <strong>private</strong> repository is visible only to a small "clique" of GitHub users (and a GitHub user is a person who owns at least one GitHub profile).

Note: To my knowledge, every page of this website is <strong>public</strong> (i.e. allegedly visible to any person with an Internet connection and who uses that Internet connection to visit this website at any time during this website's lifetime using a web browswer application).
