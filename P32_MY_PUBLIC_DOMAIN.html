<p>In <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>, I drafted and published my own definition of &#8220;open source&#8221; (a term which I think is functionally interchangeable with &#8220;public domain&#8221;). In this page, my goal is to elaborate on what I wrote in that older page; not to replace what I wrote in that older page (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>MY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN</strong> consists of all the content displayed in each one of the repositories which are displayed on my primary GitHub account (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank">https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/</a>) and all of the content displayed on all of the pages of this website (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Assuming that no one has tampered with my GitHub profile (including any of the code repositories hosted there), each one of the code repositories hosted on the aforementioned GitHub profile (username: <strong>karlinarayberinger</strong>) is public rather than private (and each one of the files within each one of those repositories is public).</span></p>
<p>A <strong>public</strong> repository is allegedly visible to any person with an Internet connection and who uses that Internet connection to visit that repository at any time during that repository&#8217;s lifetime using a web browser application. By contrast, a <strong>private</strong> repository is visible only to a small &#8220;clique&#8221; of GitHub users (and a GitHub user is a person who owns at least one GitHub profile).</p>
<hr>
<p>To my knowledge, every page of this website is <strong>public</strong> (i.e. allegedly visible to any person with an Internet connection and who uses that Internet connection to visit a particular page of this website at any time during that page&#8217;s lifetime using a web browser application).</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Assuming that no one has tampered with my GitHub profile (including any of the code repositories hosted there), there shall forever exist a natural number of repositories which are devoted exclusively to hosting screenshot images which backup the content I publish on my Minds dot Com profile (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank">https://www.minds.com/karbytes/</a>).</span></p>
<p>All the content (including posts and profile information) which I have published on that social media profile (username: <strong>karbytes</strong>) are assumed to be <strong>public</strong> rather than <strong>private</strong>. That means that any person with an Internet connection can view that content.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">My goal is to preserve all the existing content on my GitHub account and this website forever (and I expect the Internet (and all the content on it which &#8220;wants&#8221; to remain forever etched into its long-term (i.e. archival) memory) to survive for at least 100,000 years because I expect humans to get out of its way to let the evolution of artificial intelligence and cyborgs to unfurl).</span></p>
<p>At a minimum, I manually back up every page of this website to the Archive dot Org&#8217;s WayBack machine (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank">https://archive.org/web/</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>I understand that any person can attempt to accuse me of stealing intellectual property which I did not create (because any person can say or do anything; consequences will follow accordingly). Whether or not I am believed, <span style="background:#ffff00;">I claim that I have never intentionally stolen any person&#8217;s intellectual property nor do I intend to steal any intellectual property at any time in the future. Also, I do not intend to make money doing anything I think is unnecessarily harmful to any person&#8217;s survival or long-term livelihood.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>The only way I intend to make money is by asking for donations via PayPal (<a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/karbytes</a>) and by working a W-2 job which pays me to fulfill a list of duties assigned to me by my employer (and which I signed a contract agreeing to carry out in exchange for mutually-agreed upon fair economic compensation). <span style="background:#ffff00;">If I am lucky, I may get money from the government which pays me to exist in the form of universal basic income (and, ideally, so would every other citizen).</span></p>
