MY_PLUBLIC_DOMAIN

<hr>

In <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>, I drafted and published my own definition of "public source". In this page, my goal is to elaborate on what I wrote in that older page; not to replace what I wrote in that older page.

<strong>MY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN</strong> consists of all the content displayed in each one of the repositories which are displayed on my primary GitHub account (<a href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank">https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/</a>) and all of the content on all of the pages of this website (<a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a>).
