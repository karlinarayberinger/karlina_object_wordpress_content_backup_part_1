<strong>Toy Models verses Unique Events</strong>

While it is very doable to create an arbitrary set of quantitative values (derived from empirical measurements) which consistently assess the degree of harm a particular action committed by an information processing entity will likely inflict on some target information processing entity, such a model is too abstract and limited in terms of input variables that it cannot always be guaranteed to be universally applicable by any information processing entity. 

Therefore, rather than tell what people to do via some immutable codified doctrine, I prefer to tell people that ANARCHY is as structured as nature gets. In other words, situational ethics is the only legitimate ethics. 

Unless a relatively virtual model of   some relatively physical system accounts for inevitable chaos (and the possibility of having to rewrite the programmatic instructions which define that virtual model), that model is too impractical to be used as anything more than a mere toy (with very limited utility as a scientific instrument because such a model is a rigidly deterministic closed system). 

When there is only a miniscule amount of serious crisis resolution to worry about, all there is to do is have fun!

Since I am no longer in crisis mode, I am ready to slow down and have more fun with my toys.

I think I got about as humanly close as possible to making finite ethical "programs" (or, more accurately, pseudocode) which could be useful in "real world" applications: see QUALITY_OF_LIFE_METRICS and TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY for details.
