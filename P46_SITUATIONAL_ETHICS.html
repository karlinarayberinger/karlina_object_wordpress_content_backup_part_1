<p><strong>Toy Models verses Unique Events</strong></p>
<p>While it is very doable to create an arbitrary set of quantitative values (derived from empirical measurements) which consistently assess the degree of harm a particular action committed by an information processing entity will likely inflict on some target information processing entity, such a model is too abstract and limited in terms of input variables that it cannot always be guaranteed to be universally applicable by any information processing entity.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Therefore, rather than tell what people to do via some immutable codified doctrine, I prefer to tell people that <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/anarchy/" target="_blank">ANARCHY</a> is as structured as nature gets. In other words, situational ethics is the only legitimate ethics.</span></p>
<p>Unless a relatively virtual model of some relatively physical system accounts for inevitable chaos (and the possibility of having to rewrite the programmatic instructions which define that virtual model), that model is probably &#8220;too impractical&#8221; to be used as anything more than a just a toy (with very limited utility as a scientific instrument because such a model is a rigidly deterministic closed system).</p>
<p>(For an example on what a closed system looks like, see <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/pi_approximation/" target="_blank">PI_APPROXIMATION</a>. That software application simulates the randomized throwing of darts at some square-shaped canvas such that, the more randomized darts there are being thrown against the canvas, the more the ratio of darts thrown total and the darts which land inside of the inscribed circle approximate the irrational number PI. Of course, because the simulation only throws a finite number of random darts, the PI approximation generated is never going to be equivalent to the actual value of PI since PI (when represented as a decimal number) has an indefinite number of significant digits).</p>
<p>When there is only a minuscule amount of serious crisis resolution to worry about, all there is left to do is have fun!</p>
<p>Since I am no longer in crisis mode, I am ready to slow down and have more fun with my toys.</p>

<p>I think I got about as humanly close as possible to making finite ethical &#8220;programs&#8221; (or, more accurately, pseudocode) which could be useful in &#8220;real world&#8221; applications: see <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/quality_of_life_metrics/" target="_blank">QUALITY_OF_LIFE_METRICS</a> and <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/turing_complete_philosophy/" target="_blank">TURING_COMPLETE_PHILOSOPHY</a> for details.</p>
