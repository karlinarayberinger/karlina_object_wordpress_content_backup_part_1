<p>Hypothesis: a human being needs to experience a minimal degree of suffering in order to lawfully possess any sum of money if that money is based on a system which destabilizes the ecosystems of Planet Earth to an extent which seriously threatens the long-term survival of the human species (i.e. a longevity longer than a minimum of a thousand more years from now). That is because <span style="background:#ffff00;">the primitive human operating system tends to associate suffering with merit (since maintaining homeostasis requires a steady supply of nutrients which are historically only won through hunting and gathering supplies in situations which pose some non-trivial degree of risk to one&#8217;s own bodily survival).</span> Therefore, it is good for a person to only have enough money to do its best work; not enough money to deprive other persons to do the same.</p>
<p>What I propose is a parallel economy to all existing fiat and cryptocurrency which</p>
<p>(a) deploys a finite number of tokens whose total amount is directly proportional to the average total number of joules of electricity produced by relevant photovoltaic farms,</p>
<p>(b) distributes the same number of “sustenance tokens” per month to each one of the wallet owners (such that <span style="background:#ffff00;">the total number of wallets is fixed, limited to exactly one owning person, and such that wallets are issued only to non-breeding persons in order to prevent the destabilization of the unit value of exactly one (necessarily interchangeable) “sustenance token” and to reward adult human individuals for opting out of the business of making more babies instead of supporting the persons who are already born),</span> and</p>
<p>(c) withdraws all unspent tokens from each wallet at the end of its monthly reimbursement cycle before swiftly reimbursing that wallet with a full deck of cards&#8230;I mean tokens! (Yes, such <span style="background:#ffff00;">tokens can be spent on items other than food, medicine, and rent; but only for transactions which are approved as sufficiently ethical and sufficiently environmentally sustainable according to the artificially intelligent moderators of the &#8220;sustenance token&#8221; economy (where no central banks exist since only peer-to-peer wallets hold onto instantiated tokens which are countable using integer quantities)).</span></p>
