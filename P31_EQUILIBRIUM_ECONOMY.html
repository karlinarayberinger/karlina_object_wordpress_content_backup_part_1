EQUILIBRIUM_ECONOMY

<hr>

Hypothesis: a human being needs to experience a minimal degree of suffering in order to lawfully possess any sum of money if that money is based on a system which destabilizes the ecosystems of Planet Earth to an extent which seriously threatens the long-term survival of the human species (i.e. a longevity longer than a minimum of a thousand more years from now). Therefore, it is good for a person to only have enough money to do its best work; not enough money to deprive other persons to do the same. 

What I propose is a parallel economy to all existing fiat and cryptocurrency which 

(a) deploys a finite number of tokens whose total amount is directly proportional to the average total number of joules of electricity produced by relevant photovoltaic farms, 

(b) ditributes the same number of "sustanence tokens" per month to each one of the wallet owners (whose total number is fixed and inclusive of only non-breeding individuals in order to prevent the destabilization of the unit value of exactly one (necessarily interchangeable) "sustanence token" and to reward adult human individuals for opting out of the business of making more babies instead of supporting the persons who are already born (especially adults eager to utilize their talents and devote most of their free time to solving and managing existing societal problems (which having children would almost be too time-consuming and expensive to seriously get into any time while their hypothecial offspring are still legally dependent minors)), and 

(c) withdraws all unspent tokens from each wallet at the end of its monthly reimbursement cycle before swiftly reimbursing that wallet with a full deck of cards...I mean tokens! (Yes, such tokens can be spent on items other than food, medicine, and rent;but only for transactions which are approved as sufficiently ethical and sufficiently environmentally sustainable accordin to the artificially intelligent moderators of the "sustanence token" economy (where no central banks exist since only peer-to-peer wallets hold onto instantiated tokens which are countable using integer quantities)).
