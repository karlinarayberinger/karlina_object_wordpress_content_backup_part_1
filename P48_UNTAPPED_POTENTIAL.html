<p>UNTAPPED_POTENTIAL</p>
<hr>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I apologize for so frequently coming across as unnecessarily hostile, lacking in empathy towards my fellow humans, and overly hasty to make generalizing and dehumanizing judgments about humans (about specific individual humans and about groups of humans). I apologize mostly because I do not want to diminish my chances of getting a good job because I may have a seemingly permanent reputation amongst human society in general as being &#8220;excessively angry&#8221;, &#8220;anti social&#8221;, &#8220;self absorbed&#8221;, and, worst of all logically inconsistent.</p>
<p>I felt the need to get some psychological baggage cleared out of my way and exposed to the light of day for all to see. In particular, I cannot help but feel this gnawing dreadful feeling that there would be many more women in science, technology, and hardcore philosophy fields (and there would be few if any unwanted pregnancies and, as a result, significantly less ecological destruction having been dealt and still being dealt) if women were given more space, time, and incentive to be as selfish as they really are. (Of course, the same could be said for most men, but since women have historically been more oppressed and coerced into sacrificing personal ambition for making family their highest (and, many times, exclusive domain of agency), I think this stunted personal development is significantly more prominent in women than in men).</p>
<p>I take back about what I said in my previous journal entry, <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/highest_authority/" target="_blank">HIGHEST_AUTHORITY</a>, about not wanting to be some kind of teacher and to completely outsource teaching and rehabilitation services to artificial intelligence to the exclusion of humans. <span style="background:#ffff00;">In my haste to get the words out quickly, I want to emphasize that I believe that humans AND artificial intelligence NEED to collaborate (and even meld) in order for humans to survive long enough to realize much of their untapped potential.</span></p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
