<p>ENDING_PETROLEUM_TYRANNY</p>
<hr>
<p>Premise: Capitalist society seems to aggressively demand that the average working citizen rely on a petroleum powered vehicle (especially one which that citizen owns and, consequently, makes regular insurance payments towards, and also, makes &#8220;random&#8221; yet expected repair jobs towards). Such petroleum powered vehicle owners are strongly incentivized to maintain their addition to fossil fuels mining and combustion because alternative modes of transportation are not heavily invested in nor are they &#8220;allowed&#8221; by the prevailing societal normalization (of petroleum dominance and ecological diminishment).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Needless to say, the mining and combustion of fossil fuels is harmful to Earth&#8217;s ecosystem because it releases toxic chemicals into the air, water, and soil and, also, it causes the overall temperature of Earth&#8217;s oceans to warm up such that global climate patterns and biological ecosystems are severely disrupted. If humans do not stop the mining and combustion of fossil fuels soon, the human species will go extinct (and many other species on Planet Earth would also likely go extinct).</span></p>
<p>I have personally decided to devote my life towards making pollution-free energy production (especially via photovoltaics) my personal mission (even at the expense of short-term gratification and even the ability to acquire most kinds of paid jobs which I am presently qualified for). Likewise, I am more than willing to spend the rest of my life with zero friends (since the Internet provides more than enough inspiration and &#8220;role models&#8221; I can benefit from with a modest Internet connection).</p>
<p>I also do the best I can to limit my food intake to 100% plant-based (i.e. vegan) nutritional sources. As &#8220;inconvenient&#8221; as that is to do, I have been told that adhering to a plant-based diet is the most impactful way a single human being can minimize ecological harm (including animal abuse).</p>
