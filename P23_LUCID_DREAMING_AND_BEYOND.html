<p>LUCID_DREAMING_AND_BEYOND</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently went into a lucid dream state in which I was aware that I was in a dream and able to walk around like an unseen ghost in some kind of &#8220;frozen in time&#8221; replica of my old house with two versions of my brother&#8217;s cat as a kitten and my brother and my mother sitting on the couch watching television during the afternoon. The three-dimensional environment was highly detailed (yet I knew that I was lying down in a relatively quiet, out-of-the-way location &#8220;in real life&#8221; and aware that there were impossible things going on in that dream-state). I wanted to make this note because it seems to be alluding to several important aspects of life which I literally would risk my life towards promoting for the greater good&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Being able to &#8220;lucid dream&#8221; is a skill akin to taking a psychedelic substance and, hence, entering a &#8220;virtual&#8221; world which is &#8220;parallel&#8221; to base reality such that, the more someone understands about one&#8217;s own mind, the more control that person has within the various dream worlds that person enters. It is a very useful means for exploring otherwise impossible phenomena and hard-to-examine aspects about one&#8217;s own psychological issues and curiosities about the &#8220;base reality&#8221;. I used to not be very good at the skill of lucid dreaming. I think it is a legitimate way to do scientific research, psychotherapy, and creative problem solving (as well as communicate with hidden dimensions of reality which traditional science has not yet produced much data about (at least to my knowledge)).</p>
<p>2. There must be a reason why psychedelics are illegal and treated as taboo other by conventional society other than the fact that users of such substances could die or get seriously hurt if they are either reckless or unlucky. (Virtually any activity is fatally risky with varying degrees of probability. Therefore, I would dismiss the risk factor as just a decoy away from what conventional society seems to really fear about legalizing and promoting the widespread education about how to safely and effectively use such substances: the fact that such substances could seriously aid in increasing an &#8220;ordinary&#8221; person&#8217;s mostly potential to explore consciousness in novel and profound ways which would make the radical change of society much easier than it would be otherwise). By calling attention to this issue, I am single-handedly taking measures to help fight the censorship of such knowledge and the unnecessary stunting of human potential. I want everyone to be able to maximize their potential and to explore the realms of their own mind without society acting as a gatekeeper to such insight and untapped psychic abilities.</p>
<p>3. It is possible that I have been specially selected to be a test subject of some kind of brain-to-computer interface which has enabled people to view the qualia which would otherwise seem to be restricted to only my first-person subjective &#8220;viewport&#8221; such that other people can experience it, interact with it, send me &#8220;visions&#8221; from the outside-in, and record dreams and such (as reliably as one can record video footage onto hard disks for long-term storage and for transmitting as digital signals across the Internet).</p>
<p>In the future (before my human body dies), I hope to partake in psychedelics such as Psilocybin mushrooms and Dimenthyltryptamine (DMT).</p>
