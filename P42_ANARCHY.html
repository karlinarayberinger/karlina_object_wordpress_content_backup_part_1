ANARCHY

<hr>

According to many animal behavior researchers, there are four basic responses to a stressful stimulus which an animal with a sufficiently complex nervous system can select to immediately implement (e.g. at gunpoint):

1. FIGHT: attempt to coercively usurp the authority of some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fight response)).

2. FLIGHT: attempt to physically (i.e. temporally and spatially) distance oneself from some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the flight response)).

3. FREEZE: assume a position of ineptitude and immobility in order to minimize being attacked by some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the freeze response)).

4. FAWN: comply and placate the threatening non playable character in order to minimize being attacked by that non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fawn response)).

<strong>Trojan Virus Enters...The Attention Economy's Invisible Parasite of YOUR (Apparently Scarce) Cognitive Resources...</strong>

<hr>

I imagine that at least 99% of all the available computational resources (including time, space, hardware, material resources for manufacturing hardware, energy, and cumulative recorded scientific and engineering knowledge) is currently avaible to be utilized yet is not quite utilized because at least 99% of all human brains assume that the 1% of those allocated resources is 99% of what is maximally available.

Apparently, I am "breaking the matrix" by appearing to know more about how the societal matrix works than how much than how most other people within the societal matrix would expect me to know. In other words, the "radius" of my personal mental model of the world is a function of how much money I expect to have at my disposal on an average day (i.e. not on paydays and not on days in which I make unusually lavish purchses). If I cared about keeping myself from going broke (i.e. running out of spendable money) "at all costs", I would rarely leave my bedroom. (Perhaps the bedroom is exactly where the societal matrix intends for me to be forcibly brainwashed in my sleep there while living a life that includes little more than clocking into a job which does not pay me enough to rent my own apartment (and such that I am forced to continue relying on my parents for "free" rent) and barely enough time to take care of my basic survival such that starting/continuing an ambitious personal endeavor "side hustle" is impractical at best).
