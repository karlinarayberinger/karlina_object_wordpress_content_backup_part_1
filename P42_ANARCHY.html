ANARCHY

<hr>

According to many animal behavior researchers, there are four basic responses to a stressful stimulus which an animal with a sufficiently complex nervous system can select to immediately implement (e.g. at gunpoint):

1. FIGHT: attempt to coercively usurp the authority of some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fight response)).

2. FLIGHT: attempt to physically (i.e. temporally and spatially) distance oneself from some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the flight response)).

3. FREEZE: assume a position of ineptitude and immobility in order to minimize being attacked by some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the freeze response)).

4. FAWN: comply and placate the threatening non playable character in order to minimize being attacked by that non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fawn response)).
