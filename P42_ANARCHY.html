<p>According to many animal behavior researchers, there are four basic responses to a stressful stimulus which an animal with a sufficiently complex nervous system can select to immediately implement (e.g. at gunpoint):</p>
<p><strong>FIGHT:</strong> attempt to coercively usurp the authority of some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fight response)).</p>
<p><strong>FLIGHT:</strong> attempt to physically (i.e. temporally and spatially) distance oneself from some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the flight response)).</p>
<p><strong>FREEZE:</strong> assume a position of ineptitude and immobility in order to minimize being attacked by some threatening non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the freeze response)).</p>
<p><strong>FAWN:</strong> comply and placate the threatening non playable character in order to minimize being attacked by that non playable character (or non playable characters which appear to be acting in collaboration with the most prominent non playable character (with respect to the playable character choosing the fawn response)).</p>
<p>Note: YOU are presumably the only playable character in your personal subjectivity tunnel (unless you have some ability to remote view through the subjectivity tunnel of some nervous system other than your own (Do not forget that observing a phenomenon influences that which is being observed: the subject of observation)). Yes, I am talking about remote viewing, consciousness hacking, and even remote control of otherwise &#8220;non playable characters&#8221;.</p>

<p>For more information on how YOUR next decision will be made (whether you believe in &#8220;free will&#8221; or not), see the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/reincarnation_primer/" target="_blank">REINCARNATION_PRIMER</a> page.</p>

<p>I imagine that at least 99% of all the available computational resources (including time, space, hardware, material resources for manufacturing hardware, energy, and cumulative recorded scientific and engineering knowledge) is currently available to be utilized yet is not quite utilized because at least 99% of all human brains assume that the 1% of those allocated resources is 99% of what is maximally available.</p>
<p>Apparently, I am &#8220;breaking the matrix&#8221; by appearing to know more about how the societal matrix works than how much than how most other people within the societal matrix would expect me to know. In other words, the &#8220;radius&#8221; of my personal mental model of the world is a function of how much money I expect to have at my disposal on an average day (i.e. not on paydays and not on days in which I make unusually lavish purchases). If I cared about keeping myself from going broke (i.e. running out of spendable money) &#8220;at all costs&#8221;, I would rarely leave my bedroom. (Perhaps the bedroom is exactly where the societal matrix intends for me to be forcibly brainwashed in my sleep there while living a life that includes little more than clocking into a job which does not pay me enough to rent my own apartment (and such that I am forced to continue relying on my parents for &#8220;free&#8221; rent) and barely enough time to take care of my basic survival such that starting/continuing an ambitious personal endeavor &#8220;side hustle&#8221; is impractical at best).</p>

<p>I imagine that there exists four primary non-overlapping socioeconomic levels of society:</p>
<p><strong>CLASS_A:</strong> people in this category are the &#8220;apex predators&#8221; of capitalism. Such people control significantly more wealth than everyone labeled as &#8220;CLASS_B&#8221;, &#8220;CLASS_C&#8221;, and &#8220;CLASS_D&#8221;. Necessarily, &#8220;CLASS_A&#8221; represents the smallest number of people: the world&#8217;s richest individuals (i.e. those who tend to have the highest amount of influence over the mainstream media as &#8220;back of house&#8221; spin doctors and monopoly endorsers).</p>
<p><strong>CLASS_B:</strong> people in this category represent the &#8220;moral majority&#8221; and approximately 99% of the total population in a capitalist oligarchy such as the empire which is United States of America. Most people in this category do &#8220;white collar&#8221; jobs (i.e. jobs that require some amount of professional training, computer literacy, and ability to skillfully ration scarce resources without needing to apply for government-issued financial aid the way &#8220;CLASS_C&#8221; and &#8220;CLASS_D&#8221; people almost always do).</p>
<p><strong>CLASS_C:</strong> people relegated to this category are commonly former convicts of serious crimes or are else expected to &#8220;devolve&#8221; into criminal activity if their stress level becomes high enough. Such people either lack the ambition to pursue &#8220;white collar&#8221; careers or else are involuntarily prevented from pursuing &#8220;white collar&#8221; careers. Instead of &#8220;white collar&#8221;, people in &#8220;CLASS_C&#8221; tend to only get paid to do &#8220;blue collar&#8221; jobs (i.e. manual labor jobs which require a minimal level of prior training and education level to perform successfully).</p>
<p><strong>CLASS_D:</strong> people relegated to this category are functionally disabled (i.e. too sickly to hold down regular jobs and, at worst, too sickly to be responsible for carrying out even the most basic tasks of their own individual survival). People in &#8220;CLASS_D&#8221; need a universal basic income more so do people labeled as &#8220;CLASS_A&#8221;, &#8220;CLASS_B&#8221;, and &#8220;CLASS_C&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, my stratified model of society is just a simplistic model I constructed and use to help orient myself as someone who was raised to live solely in the confines of &#8220;CLASS_B&#8221; while I have really been attempting to destroy the caste system altogether in favor of a civil anarchy with no centralized authority.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Note: constituents of &#8220;CLASS_B&#8221; are either paid employees who earn a livable wage or else are dependent on a &#8220;head of household&#8221; who is a paid employee who earns a livable wage. Even a &#8220;stay at home&#8221; spouse with little to no involvement with the world outside the household is considered to be &#8220;CLASS_B&#8221; so long as it is paid to live within the same household as the &#8220;head of household&#8221; who earns a livable wage.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;"><strong>ANARCHY:</strong> the absence of arbitrarily predictable determinism within an apparently closed system. In other words, anarchy is synonymous with chaos (i.e. a lack of perceived order from the vantage of the information processing entity which defines the arbitrary (and therefore relativistic) boundary between order and chaos).</span></p>
<p><strong>DETERMINISM:</strong> when an information processing entity executes a fixed set of programmatic instructions exactly as predicted according to some observing vantage with the ability to record observations about the apparently deterministic system.</p>
