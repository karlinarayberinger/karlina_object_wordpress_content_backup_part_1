<p>KINDNESS_OVER_LOVE</p>
<hr>
<p>Love is a word which might as well be interchangeable with kindness; however, love seems to ooze with emotional urgency while kindness is generally calmer, cooler, and less animalistic in its historical context (at least from my limited perspective).</p>
<p>Kindness is a sufficiently sentient organism consciously wanting for itself and/or for another organism to thrive rather than to suffer.</p>
<p>At a minimum, kindness is a mere conscious intention which helps to prime the mind of that intention&#8217;s beholder to allocate cognitive resources towards thinking about the welfare of some target organism.</p>
<p>At a maximum, kindness is a deliberate action towards assisting that target organism in the goal of maximizing that target organism&#8217;s welfare by channeling that kind thought process into pragmatic actions which measurably improve the target organism&#8217;s welfare.</p>
<p>I reject the word love in favor of kindness because I think love is overly hyped up by the religious and cultural traditions of human apes who seem to need an excessive degree of ceremonial rituals and theatrical acts of self importance when simple, humble kindness would be even more helpful to the recipient.</p>
<p>love : kindness :: self-worship :: selfless-exchange.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I think kindness is nothing more than extended self interest, quite frankly.</span> I only call it a selfless exchange because, from a systemic perspective, the giver and the receiver of kindness are one entity attempting to achieve minimally satisfying (and imperfect) economic equilibrium.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The goal of kindness is to minimize the net suffering of the known universe.</span></p>
