<p>&#8220;I am not trying to tell you what to do. Instead, I am merely trying to tell you what the consequences of your actions likely will be.&#8221; &#8211; Anonymous</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am trying to tell human beings other than just myself what to do. That is because I think I am more knowledgeable about, interested in, and competent towards solving global problems than most humans probably are.&#8221; &#8211; Anonymous</p>

<p>To make an otherwise detailed story comparatively succinct, I am just now starting to personally understand the importance of not &#8220;acting white&#8221; in the region I am currently too economically destitute to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acting white&#8221; is when any person flaunts its apparently expensive academic background to an audience of persons who apparently have been involuntarily prevented from attaining such an academic background (especially where such academic prowess in apparently unnecessary).</p>
<p>(From what I can tell, the primary barrier preventing people from advancing academically is a lack of sufficient free time in which to study and a lack of sufficient money by which to purchase courses, school supplies, and tuition at both &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; educational institutions in addition to online schools. People who tend to lack such free time and education funds probably were raised to assume that such things were not a priority. Otherwise, their parents would have not chosen to raise children at all (given that such parents were barely able to afford the basic costs of living even without opting to have children (which makes me wonder how many impoverished children were actually the product of rape and forced marriage))).</p>
<p>The opposite of &#8220;acting white&#8221; is being humble, sycophantic, and nonchalant about matters other than caring for one&#8217;s own circle of friends, colleagues, household members, and relatives.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Apparently, I need to minimize how much I &#8220;act white&#8221; offline in order to ingratiate myself to those who might give me food, money, and other economic resources I want (and need).</span> Otherwise, the locals will dismiss me as presumably too wealthy and too well-supported at whatever Nazi mansion I am presumably an eternally cherished member of (and such locals may even attempt to sabotage my efforts to advance myself academically and economically as punishment for not conforming to their accepted status quo).</p>
<p>Although intelligence does not always correlate with economic affluence, it usually almost always done in traditional human civilization. <span style="background:#ffff00;">To avoid escalating conflict with irritable monkeys, I might as well superficially pretend that I am only as intelligent as I am economically wealthy.</span> (Otherwise, someone might steal or destroy my laptop as punishment for appearing too pretentious to them).</p>

<p><strong>ELITISM:</strong> treating people who are established experts in their respective academic and professional fields as more qualified to make administrative decisions about how to run their encompassing government than are people who lack such expertise.</p>
<p><strong>ANTI-ELITISM:</strong> treating all persons as individually deserving the same level of competence to make administrative decisions about how to run their encompassing government irregardless of their educational or professional backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>DEMOCRACY:</strong> a person&#8217;s vote always counts as exactly 1 unit of governmental influence.</p>
<p><strong>MERITOCRACY:</strong> a person&#8217;s vote increments by some natural number of units of governmental influence as a function of how well that particular person demonstrates competence to make intelligent decisions.</p>
<p><strong style="background:#ffff00;">elitism : meritocracy :: anti-elitism : democracy.</strong></p>

<p>As a corollary&#8230;</p>
<p>In the society I live in, women are trained to act submissive towards the men who hoard the majority of the economic resources (including means of transportation and means of electronic communications) and the majority of the cultural space in which to broadcast subjective opinions and preferences. A woman who does not subjugate herself to an &#8220;alpha&#8221; man&#8217;s authority is generally socially ostracized, demonized as a parasitic villain, and sometimes even physically tortured, maimed, and killed. Women tend to be &#8220;innocent&#8221; and &#8220;helpless&#8221; bystanders to the subjugation of women and girls to male chauvinist authority (because to do otherwise is &#8220;acting white&#8221; and &#8220;acting white&#8221; is not in vogue at the time and place in human history in which I am indefinitely stationed).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">A woman who acts as the authority of her own academic or professional livelihood, physical body, mental qualities, and money is generally regarded as a threat to an &#8220;alpha&#8221; man&#8217;s ego.</span> For that woman&#8217;s safety, it is advised that she placate the nearest &#8220;alpha&#8221; man&#8217;s ego. Otherwise, she will likely be brutally harassed and sabotaged by guardians of the male chauvinist culture (which is highly regarded at the local time and place in which I live).</p>
<hr>
<p>Needless to say (given that nothing I say is &#8220;needed&#8221; by anyone other than myself), <span style="background:#ffff00;">what I have written on this page (or anywhere on this website or linked social media accounts) is a bit hyperbolic for cathartic purposes. Readers are advised to be skeptical of what I say and to not take it as absolute truth or gospel.</span></p>
