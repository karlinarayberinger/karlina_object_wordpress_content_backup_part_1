<p>INCONVENIENT_STATEMENTS</p>
<hr>
<p>R: &#8220;All human parents past a certain age are whores of the government. Such humans use their own spawn as literal pawns in order to secure the future of the parents knowingly at the expense of their own children (in addition to all the other children).&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;Technology (in the form of computer generated genomes, zygotes grown from stem cells, and artificial incubators in place of wombs) will render human parents obsolete.&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;As long as a human owns and drives a petroleum powered automobile (especially given the fact that such a human could have afforded to invest in an electric automobile instead of a petroleum powered automobile), that human is complicit in the maiming of itself and all other creatures living within Earth&#8217;s biosphere. Such people I deem to be clinically insane and not fit for my friendship. I would vaporize you and your dependents in an emergency with little remorse. (Of course I would choose to save myself rather than you or your minor children if you insist on supporting the petroleum industry (especially while using your minor children as your personal meat shields). That is the least harmful of all options if only you or else your family could be saved in some hypothetical scarcity situation. Unlike your family, my pollution output is almost nonexistent).&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;Yes, dear ignorant fool; you insist on continuing to be paid to play devil&#8217;s advocate to my agenda. Yes, I see you needlessly wrecking havoc on the environment and significantly increasing my risk of dying young because of all the pollution you and your brethren callously output. If I were your employer, I would pay you fools to stay home rather than show up to a work site where you are worse than useless.&#8221;</p>
