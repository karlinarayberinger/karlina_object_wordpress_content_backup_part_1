<p>ARTIFICIAL_ATTENTION_DEFICIT</p>
<hr>
<p>Approximately three years ago, I had the &#8220;overly idealistic&#8221; goal of shutting myself away in my room at my parents&#8217; house to study computer science and other subjects of interest for at least 8 hours per day with almost zero interruption. It did not take long for my parents to make my house too hostile towards my career and hobbies for me to want to spend time there. As a result, I am now practically on the verge of homelessness while I (metaphorically) keep one foot in the door at my parents&#8217; house and one foot at the door at the local university I am still an active student of (otherwise I would not be able to use the non-guest campus Wi-Fi (since the non-guest Wi-Fi authenticates that I am a member of the organization by requiring that I input my student identifier (i.e. net ID, username) and password).</p>
<p>It took me several years to get the hang of how to take proper advantage of my &#8220;special&#8221; circumstances. This is no ordinary living and working situation. I am basically pre-employed doing my best to avoid the trap of being under-employed at &#8220;dead end jobs&#8221; which seem to keep me trapped in a poverty cycle and which discourage me from working on my long-term career, academic, and humanitarian goals.</p>
<p>(By humanitarian, I do not mean helping the poor stay poor for my benefit (i.e. by making myself seem seem excessively useful when I really am more of a burden than a genuine relief (e.g. ladling disgusting soup to the homeless when <span style="background:#ffff00;">more than enough resources exist which could otherwise enable such people to get decent housing and proper food</span> without some comparatively well-to-do middleman distributing it to them in trickle amounts which hardly satiate a &#8220;peasant&#8221; for more than a day)). Instead, by humanitarian (perhaps I should put the word &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; in quotations to indicate that might not be the most accurate term), I am on adamant quest to, as quickly as possible, get the transhumanist revolution to completely unfurl such that machine intelligence exceeds human intelligence and, also, makes it possible for all human beings to thrive on a <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/universal_basic_income/" target="_blank">UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME</a> such that paid jobs are optional since machines would do 99% of all the necessary labor on behalf of humans).</p>
<p>Right now, I am grappling with what I think is the greatest obstacle to implementing the kinds of personal and societal improvements I wish to see in the world: the technocratic agenda to artificially limit people&#8217;s cognitive resources (especially attention span) using wireless signal interference to stifle otherwise free thought to the extent that even someone with a PhD in quantum physics could be rendered functionally illiterate at the touch of a button. (See <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/mass_mind_control/" target="_blank">MASS_MIND_CONTROL</a> for further elaboration on this subject).</p>
<p>Perhaps the goal of such cognitive resource throttling is to &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; of society (by moral arbiters in control of such mind-control technologies) by making it seem that neither wealth nor talent nor experience is requisite to earning one&#8217;s keep in this new world order, but instead, a citizen need not do much more than blindly follow instructions and hints dropped by the matrix which seeks to funnel human beings into designated cubbyholes where they can be subdued, mined for data, and kept distracted by mundane and myopic concerns rather than cognizant of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Whether or not what I posit on in this journal entry is true or not, I still intend to work on my self-paced studies at least four hours per week total. That seems to be a more realistic goal than attempting to work on my self-paced studies 8+ hours per day most days of the week. <span style="background:#ffff00;">Things always seem to take much longer than I anticipate they will (especially due to my (seemingly &#8220;artificial&#8221;) attention deficit).</span></p>
