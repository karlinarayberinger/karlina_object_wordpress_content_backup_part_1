The following three qualities are seemingly necessary to make a compelling argument:

<strong>LOGOS:</strong> the quality of an argument appearing to have <span style="background:#ffff00;">logical consistency</span> to the target audience.

<strong>ETHOS:</strong> the quality of an argument appearing to have <span style="background:#ffff00;">credibility</span> due to the fact that the argument's author has sufficient personal experience and personal involvement about what the argument describes.

<strong>PATHOS:</strong> the quality of an argument appearing to have sufficient ability to convince the target audience to agree with the author's argument due to the fact that the informational content and delivery method of such an argument has the ability to exert <span style="background:#ffff00;">emotional influence</span> upon the target audience.

Personally, I think that LOGOS is, by far, the most important component of composing a compelling argument. That is because logic is the actual subject matter of such an argument (and logic includes things such as cited <span style="background:#ffff00;">empirical evidence and abstract proofs</span> using symbolic statements which are mathematically sound).

Secondary to LOGOS, in my opinion, is ETHOS. That is because anyone can make a logically sound argument. An argument is more compelling to the target audience if the logical statement is backed by actual lived experience and personal investment on behalf of its author. Otherwise, the argument might as well have been copy-pasted from someone else (which is <span style="background:#ffff00;">plagiarism</span>).

Finally, PATHOS is the least important to me out of all three qualities aforementioned in this journal entry. That is because PATHOS appeals to the most primitive aspects of the target audience (i.e. the amygdala more so than the cerebral cortex of a target audience's organic brain).
