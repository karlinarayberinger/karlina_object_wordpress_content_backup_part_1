S: "Is my happiness necessary?"

T: "It depends on whom you are asking."

S: "Is my happiness necessary to any sentient being?"

T: "As far as I can tell, no. Your continued existence does not seem to depend on you being happy."

S: "What does my continued existence depend on?"

T: "Your long term survival is a function whose output is always random to some degree greater than zero."

S: "What are the quantities and units of input of that function? What are the quantities and units of output of that function?"

T: "The output is some nonnegative integer quantity of milliseconds between 'now' and some estimated 'death point' in the future in which your physical body is no longer the vessel of your 'current' ego."

T: "The input is the 'current' state of the entire universe (i.e. your ego and/or your encompassing environment)."

S: "What is my happiness dependent upon?"

T: "Your happiness is the function you either copy from some other ego and/or create from scratch <span style="background:#ffff00;">('inside of' your own ego (and the ego is basically your single-room artist studio))</span> which assigns the inputs as I have previously described to their respective outputs."

R: "My function always outputs a sufficiently high output value because I am willing to be optimistic to the point of delusion and risk that I will be 'forced' to update my function and, therefore, be 'forced' to update my ego, in order for my ego to survive for as long as possible."

Q: "R is a rational optimist. R can always generate a sufficiently convincing set of logical arguments to keep on living at all costs. I am not so optimistic as R is because I would not want to murder innocent peers in order to extend my own individual life span."
