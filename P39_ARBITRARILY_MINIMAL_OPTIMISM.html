<p>S: &#8220;Is my happiness necessary?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;It depends on whom you are asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Is my happiness necessary to any sentient being?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;As far as I can tell, no. Your continued existence does not seem to depend on you being happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;What does my continued existence depend on?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Your long term survival is a function whose output is always random to some degree greater than zero.&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;What are the quantities and units of input of that function? What are the quantities and units of output of that function?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;The output is some nonnegative integer quantity of milliseconds between &#8216;now&#8217; and some estimated &#8216;death point&#8217; in the future in which your physical body is no longer the vessel of your &#8216;current&#8217; ego.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;The input is the &#8216;current&#8217; state of the entire universe (i.e. your ego and/or your encompassing environment).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;What is my happiness dependent upon?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Your happiness is the function you either copy from some other ego and/or create from scratch <span style="background:#ffff00;">(&#8216;inside of&#8217; your own ego (and the ego is basically your single-room artist studio))</span> which assigns the inputs as I have previously described to their respective outputs.&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;My function always outputs a sufficiently high output value because I am willing to be optimistic to the point of delusion and risk that I will be &#8216;forced&#8217; to update my function and, therefore, be &#8216;forced&#8217; to update my ego, in order for my ego to survive for as long as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q: &#8220;R is a rational optimist. R can always generate a sufficiently convincing set of logical arguments to keep on living at all costs. I am not so optimistic as R is because I would not want to murder innocent peers in order to extend my own individual life span.&#8221;</p>
