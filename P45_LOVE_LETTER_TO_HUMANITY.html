<p>LOVE_LETTER_TO_HUMANITY</p>
<hr>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>In the previous journal entry, <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/folly_of_pity/" target="_blank">FOLLY_OF_PITY</a>, I berated female humans in general for merely advertising their fertility and using it to make themselves happy. Whether I approve of how a female human uses her (or its) body is not within my control (and even of it were, I would minimize my interference in her (or its) activities). Also, I did not mean to imply that female humans are any more or less contemptible to me than are male humans. Historically speaking, I have benefited just about equally from both men and women (so please disregard my misanthropic commentary as just the sleep deprived rantings of someone suffering species dysphoria and extreme impatience of wanting its own idealistic futuristic utopia to unfold yesterday).</p>
<p>Words are cheap and not guaranteed to be factually accurate nor emotionally sincere nor obligated to be interpreted in exactly one way. Nevertheless, words have some limited value in being able to crudely transmit ideas that would otherwise remain confined to the unclaimed cognitive throughput stream which &#8220;cyber cops&#8221; ruthlessly data mine for &#8220;free&#8221; gems of insight which can be sold, bought, and patented as legally &#8220;authorless&#8221; pieces of intellectual property. Part of the reason I write and fail to fail at being anonymous online (since it is physically impossible for me to remain anonymous) is to claim at least some of my own thoughts (preferably juicy and succinct snippets of philosophical refreshment) as my own original intellectual property (while licensing whatever I publish as public domain since everything I express has presumably already been intercepted and copied into a secret government database so that agents can claim exclusive ownership and selling rights of my own intellectual property before I do). Meanwhile, seemingly everyone tells me to not worry about such matters, stop writing, stop thinking so much, and just go back to pretending to enjoy pretending to be a simpleton for everyone&#8217;s convenience but my own.</p>
<p>I am not misanthropic, but I am close enough. In other words, I really do not hate any particular human individual nor do I hate the human species. I am frequently disgusted by humans and how sadistic they often are and how generally indifferent they are to saving Planet Earth&#8217;s biosphere from further ecological destabilization, degradation, and destruction. I appreciate humanity&#8217;s ambition and power to terraform planets and to invent machines capable of outsmarting themselves. There are infinite qualities I could sing hymns of praise which exalt humanity as bastions of what it calls virtue; but I seriously do not want to waste another pollution-filled breath on those pigs on pedestals. Instead, I would rather avoid eye contact and socializing with humans as much as necessary (and especially to avoid feeding the humans what they seem to have an insatiable craving for: animosity and attention directed at them; a spewing of excessively colorful descriptions about how relevant they are to whatever I would otherwise be thinking about if they were not so prominent in my field of awareness so often and so intensely).</p>
<p>The cure seems to be for me to simply learn how to starve myself and other humans of narcissistic supply. I will do my best not to starve humans of what they physically need if I can provide it, but from what I can tell, humans are generally too predisposed to escalate conflict because to quietly live and let live is apparently too anticlimactic for the sensationalist news addicted humans. Oh well! I did my best to send y&#8217;all my &#8220;love&#8221; in the form of this drivel-laden love letter. It is time for me to squeeze out one last orange page before I start squeezing out more green pages.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Karlina Ray Beringer (karbytes)</p>
