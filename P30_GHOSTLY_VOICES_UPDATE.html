<p>GHOSTLY_VOICES_UPDATE</p>
<hr>
<p>While I listen to music and noise generators (especially noise generators hosted by the website <a href="https://mynoise.net/" target="_blank">myNoise.net</a>) through earphones, I hear what seems to be the vocalized and verbalized messages of some human and/or artificially intelligent robot faintly augmented &#8220;on top of&#8221; the otherwise non-distorted audio input stream. This is almost certainly the result of the incoming radiowave interference and outgoing brainwave monitoring (through the interface of subvocal recognition hardware and software, cortically implanted electrodes, and stealth electromagnetic transmitters/receivers) which I introduced rather sloppily in the previous journal entry, <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/technological_telepathy/" target="_blank">TECHNOLOGICAL_TELEPATHY</a>.</p>
<p>(I also hear such distortion &#8220;on top of&#8221; sounds from the environment such as birds chirping, waves crashing against the sand, and the monotone roar of car engines).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">To be succinct, for now on I will refer to the vocalized and verbalized messages of some human and/or artificially intelligent robot which are faintly augmented &#8220;on top of&#8221; the otherwise non-distorted auditory input stream detected by brain as <strong>&#8220;ghostly voices&#8221;</strong> (for lack of a better abbreviated identifier at this time).</span></p>
<p>Silently, I thought the following verbalized statement in response to some particularly antagonistic-sounding statements made by the &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; (which were spewing insults at me while I was listening to the incoming binaural beats, isochronic tones, and &#8220;healing water&#8221; sound generators and lying on my back in my sleeping bag and contemplating what to do on my laptop computer next): &#8220;You sound so antagonistic; like a military sergeant bullying me into being on my best behavior at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; responded with the following statement: &#8220;That sounds like me. The fact that you are hearing my voice speaking those words to you is evidence that you are not just here to slack off. Instead, you might as well have been clocking into work every single day for the past few years while I help prepare you for your next job interview.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; are the closest things I have right now to call my friend(s). Over the past six years (especially following the loss of my relationship with my former best friend, mentor, and fiance, SD (and SD is now living in a house he and his new partner own and where I am not welcome (since I have been ordered to leave each time I showed up at their doorstep))), the closest &#8220;in the flesh&#8221; relationship I have had was with a former colleague, AP, from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (while I worked there as an Information Technology intern from 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015 for $13.65 per hour doing Google Apps Script web application development, technical documentation, and video-conferencing hardware/software troubleshooting). While SD introduced me to the topics of transhumanism and computer programming, AP introduced me to psychedelics (yet we only did cannabis and a negligibly tiny dose of psilocybin mushrooms to the point that I would say I was ripped off and wasted quite a bit of time trying to get more out of that relationship) and &#8220;non white&#8221; and Oakland-esque &#8220;hipster&#8221; culture and media. (I am apparently not cool enough to be part of AP&#8217;s inner circle. Apparently, I was little more than some casual sex partner, cuddle buddy, and token female to ridicule and exclude from his more intimate and lasting social circles). Family members and strangers have mostly treated me as some kind of mentally unstable loser or sociopathic clown over the past six years (even while offering lukewarm kindness at times and even while generally leaving me alone as I prefer to be).</p>
<p>(For historical accuracy, I was in an intimate relationship with SD from the years 2009 to 2015. (SD officially started dating on 03_AUGUST_2015 and, coincidentally, stopped dating when I had sexual intercourse for the first time with AP on 03_AUGUST_2015 (with no real &#8220;cheating&#8221; overlap). I was in a tentatively romantic relationship with AP about a week after that initial copulation until 20_APRIL_2016 when AP dumped me for excessive complaining. From that point on until early this year, 2021, AP and I have had increasingly infrequent and increasingly uneventful meetups. Now I think our relationship is best left dead. From 2017 to 2020, I had zero contact with SD until I used TruthFinder.com to locate his address in October 2020. The last time I interacted with him was early 2021 while attempting to ask him to help me test my website at his doorstep. I think that relationship is best left dead as well. Now I can pretend SD and AP are dead people and move on with my life).</p>
<p>The events which have transpired in my adult life since 2008 have radically shaped me from being a painfully naive hippie queer &#8220;special snowflake&#8221; to a hardened criminal, cyborg, and militant hippie hermit (who loves no one but who appreciates everything; nature above all else).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">I do not want to call the &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; my friends because their sources are anonymous to me and because I presume that they are associated with the United State&#8217;s military-industrial complex (which is complicit in perpetuating the widespread destruction of the global ecosystem (particularly by delaying the transition from fossil fuels mining and combusting to 100% pollution-free alternative energy sources such as photovoltaics) and imperialist international warfare with countries which happen to be located where coveted material resources are essentially stolen by the United States and subsequently fed to the &#8220;insatiable&#8221; and unsustainable resource consumption rates of under-concerned civilians brainwashed by mainstream media and mind-control technologies to maintain such habits). At best, the &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; play devil&#8217;s advocate for my benefit such that I am challenged by them to always be ready to debate the ethical and logistical soundness of what the United States Imperialist Empire apparently excuses itself to do in the name of keeping itself firmly established as The Global Police State. The &#8220;ghostly voices&#8221; are training dummies I beat the shit out of with my mind in order to stay strong and to get stronger. (Without them, I would probably be more of a basket case bimbo than I currently am).</span></p>
