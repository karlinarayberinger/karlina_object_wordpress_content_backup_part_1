Service Jobs (Skilled) verses Workfare Jobs (Unskilled)

Workfare is a rather colloquial term which is derived from the term welfare (and welfare is a colloquial term which refers to government-issued financial aid to citizens who are classified as being too impoverished to pay for basic household necessities through the income they earn supposedly by working some minimally-skilled wage job or by receiving gift money from friends, relatives, and donors). Basically, workfare is a term I define as some kind of low-skilled, entry-level wage job which typically pays people to remain poor (but not not so poor that they are legitimately homeless and starving) by doing tasks which are time-consuming and monotonous in order to (a) keep such workers out of trouble and (b) to allow employers to stealth data mine such employees in order to sell that data for a profit (which makes up for the fact that the employees cost the employer more to employ than to outsource such jobs to comparatively efficient robots).

Why would any human settle for workfare as anything more than a transitional job while attending vocational school or university to gain the requisite skills for higher paying jobs which are actually existentialist fulfilling to perform? My assumption is that people who remain stagnant at workfare situations are usually accustomed to relying on membership to some kind of non-professional relationship with someone who pays them to remain stagnant. In other words, people who remain poor seem to do so because they have been brainwashed into favoring tribalism over individual achievement (especially by getting married or producing offspring which keep such people tethered to their "misery loves company" tribe of slackers who promote menial, environmentally destructive, and obsolete labor over genuine personal evolution and spiritual fulfillment).
