To make an otherwise detailed story comparatively succinct, I am just now starting to personally understand the importance of not "acting white" in the region I am currently too economically destitute to leave.

"Acting white" is when any person flaunts its apparently expensive academic background to an audience of persons who apparently have been involuntarily prevented from attaining such an academic background (especially where such academic prowess in apparently unnecessary). 

The opposite of "acting white" is being humble, sycophantic, and nonchalant about matters other than caring for one's own circle of friends, colleagues, household members, and relatives. 

Apparently, I need to minimize how much I "act white" offline in order to ingratiate myself to those who might give me food, money, and other economic resources I want (and need). Otherwise, the locals will dismiss me as presumably too wealthy and too well-supported at whatever Nazi mansion I am presumably an eternally cherished member of.

Although intelligence does not always correlate with economic affluence, it usually almost always done in traditional human civilization.

ELITISM: treating people who are established experts in their respective academic and professional fields as more qualified to make administrative decisions about how to run their encompassing government than are people who lack such expertise.

ANTI-ELITISM: treating all persons as individually deserving the same level of competence to make administrative decisions about how to run their encompassing government irregardless of their educational or professional backgrounds.

In the society I live in, women are trained to act submissive towards the men who hoard the majority of the economic resources (including means of transportation and means of electronic communications) and the majority of the cultural space in which to broadcast subjective opinions and preferences. A woman who does not subjugate herself to an "alpha" man's authority is generally socially ostracized, demonized as a parasitic villain, and sometimes even physically tortured, maimed, and killed. Women tend to be "innocent" and "helpless" bystanders to the subjugation of women and girls to male chauvinist authority (because to do otherwise is "acting white" and "acting white" is not in vogue at this time and place in human history).

A woman who acts as the authority of her own academic or professional livelihood, physical body, mental qualities, and money is generally regarded as a threat to an "alpha" man's ego. For that woman's safety, it is advised that she placate the nearest "alpha" man's ego. Otherwise, she will likely be brutally harassed and sabotaged by guardians of the male chauvinist culture (which is highly regarded at the local time and place in which I live).
