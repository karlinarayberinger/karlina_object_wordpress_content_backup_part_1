S: "Is my happiness necessary?"

T: "It depends on whom you are asking."

S: "Is my happiness necessary to any sentient being?"

T: "As far as I can tell, no. Your continued existence does not seem to depend on you being happy."

S: "What does my continued existence depend on?"

T: "Your long term survival is a function whose output is always random to some degree greater than zero."

S: "What are the quantities and units of input of that function? What are the quantities and units of output of that function?"

T: "The output is some nonnegative integer quantity of milliseconds between 'now' and some estimated 'death point' in the future in which your physical body is no longer the vessel of your 'current' ego."
