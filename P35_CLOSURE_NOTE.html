CLOSURE_NOTE

<hr>

I am afraid of wasting my life pursuing goals that ultimately feel unsatisfying to me or else not pursuing any goals other than compliance with the status quo (which people other than myself set for me).

I am afraid of never getting enough time, space, and knowledge about how the world works such that I can genuinely enjoy my periods of rest.

After consuming approximately 20 milligrams of THC (TetraHydroCannabinol derived from the cannabis plant) in pill form, I feel that intensity of being immersed in the here and now; eager to capture insights as notes written in black ink on spiral-bound notebook paper; hiding in the science building basement and away from any windows other than the glass door leading into the long corridor illuminated by fluorescent lights.
