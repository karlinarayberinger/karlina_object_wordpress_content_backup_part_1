<p>S: &#8220;Pity serves no one except for the beholder of pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Do elaborate. What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;I see you making exaggerated displays of anguish in your attempts to communicate that you feel pity for someone you seem to think you are unable to legitimately help.&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;What are you suggesting I do: look at the poor creature with a stone-faced expression of indifference?&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Yes. It is impossible for you to lie, so you might as well get used to always being honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be more likely to actually think favorably of women in general once I see a sufficiently high percentage of them not behaving as though femaleness were some kind of disability preventing them from doing ambitious things (and baring offspring is not exactly ambitious (and neither is doing the bare minimum to keep one&#8217;s own offspring minimally well)). So many female humans seem to think that flaunting their secondary sexual characteristics is necessary to their basic survival. I would, therefore, welcome a dramatic increase in androgyny and even in asexuality across the entire human population (especially in female humans). For so long, sex has been used as an advertising gimmick to sell a high volume of products and to keep the masses sedated in some kind of hypnotic trance of hyper consumption. I think sex is almost always a waste of resources (and that <span style="background:#ffff00;">literally all procreation can be outsourced to computer-generated genotypes, stem cell zygotes, and artificial wombs</span>).&#8221; &#8211; Anonymous</p>

<p>I, Karlina Ray Beringer (karbytes), sincerely suspect that people (most likely government-authorized hackers, spies, and general agents) have been intercepting incoming monetary donations, telecommunications messages, and physical packages which would have otherwise reached me by now. (I also seriously suspect that stealthy security guards have been monitoring my thoughts, behavior, physiology, and sensory throughput very intently for at least two years and probably longer. (For more elaboration on this topic, see the <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/consciousness_multiplexing/" target="_blank">CONSCIOUSNESS_MULTIPLEXING</a> page)).</p>
<p>I think that I am a test subject in an experiment about how monetary wealth, formal education, informal experience, biological makeup, and artificially-implanted stimuli shape a human ego across its lifetime. Perhaps the researcher committee decided to withhold the donations which would have otherwise reached my PayPal account by now until that committee decides that I am &#8220;ready&#8221; to handle my own money (in &#8220;large&#8221; amounts). Perhaps there is no &#8220;large&#8221; amount of money waiting for me to be &#8220;ready&#8221; to receive it.</p>
<p>If I had to choose between becoming wealthy right now or else instantiating a Universal Basic Income, I would choose the latter. Yes, I would extend UBI even to breeders at this point. Just ensure that no child grows up without a government-run educational institution which includes a place for children to live in separate units from their parents (since I think parents use children too much as pets and excuses to lack ambition).</p>
