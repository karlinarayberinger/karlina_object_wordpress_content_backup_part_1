<p>Today, while perusing Wikipedia, I came across the following an article introducing the subject of &#8220;subvocal recognition&#8221;. Below is the URL to that article and some highlighted passages from that article:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;A set of electrodes are attached to the skin of the throat and, without opening the mouth or uttering a sound, the words are recognized by a computer&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The Brain Computer Interface R&amp;D program at Wadsworth Center under the New York State department of health has confirmed the existing ability to decipher consonants and vowels from imagined speech, which allows for brain-based communication using imagined speech&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8230;US Patents on silent communication technologies include: US Patent 6587729 &#8220;Apparatus for audibly communicating speech using the radio frequency hearing effect&#8221;, US Patent 5159703 &#8220;Silent subliminal presentation system&#8221;, US Patent 6011991 &#8220;Communication system and method including brain wave analysis and/or use of brain activity&#8221;, US Patent 3951134 &#8220;Apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves&#8221;&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>The subject of subvocal recognition seems to be an important missing puzzle piece in my growing understanding of what the hell is happening to me. I will explain&#8230;</p>
<p>Since February 2019, I started noticing auditory phenomena in the form of distinctly foreign vocalized verbal messages and sound effects concurring with my own unspoken verbalized thoughts which are too novel and coincidental in their descriptions of reality beyond my own personal scope of knowledge for me to assume such &#8220;voices&#8221; are mere auditory hallucinations generated by my naked brain. (I have also noticed seemingly implanted visual phenomena such as phosphenes and phantom tactile and olfactory phenomena which I also assume were broadcast to my brain from remote sources using cortically implanted diodes, external sensors and transmitters, and other stealth brain-to-computer interfaces and neural prosthetics in general).</p>
<p>My current assumption is that the United States military-industrial complex installed such machinery into my body while I was unconscious (and without my remembered knowledge or consent of such a procedure) while I was briefly incarcerated at Santa Rita County Jail for committing domestic assault (i.e. throwing a metal teaspoon at the back of another person&#8217;s head). I hypothesize that I was selected as a test subject for some kind of &#8220;top secret&#8221; (yet &#8220;hidden in plain sight&#8221;) technological telepathy research project such that I am able to speak without moving my mouth or vocal chords through subvocal recognition implants which translate electrical signals to and from brain activity (particularly the regions of the brain which process verbal communication) with anonymous government agents.</p>
<p>To this day I have yet to encounter a single human being online or offline who has taken what I have to say on this matter seriously. Instead, everyone I have talked to about this subject has been quick to dismiss what I had to say as mere insanity or narcissistic attention seeking. Hence, I have mostly given up trying to initiate conversations about technical subjects with laypeople (i.e. the relatively technologically and scientifically illiterate majority of the human population at this time). Of course, I hope and expect that the technological telepathy enhancements and knowledge about how they work will be commonplace in less than 50 years.</p>
<p>Right now, I intuit that I am in the beginning phase of discovering on my own (yet with guided telepathic assistance) this &#8220;hidden&#8221; world of brain augmentation. I think that such brain augmentation is being used right now to force me to pay attention to what the military-industrial complex deems appropriate such rather than leave me to &#8220;waste time&#8221; bumping around blind and naked (metaphorically speaking) without telepathic assistance.</p>
<p>I know I brag a bit in this website. That is because I do not have the patience to placate the slow witted, anti-progressive readers and critics of my work (as a relatively independent researcher and author) by letting them set the precedent for how fast I should move from one subject to the next and which subject matter to focus on. I figure that, if such people care enough about something, those people will get off their lazy ass (metaphorically speaking) and do their own damn research instead of waiting for &#8220;experts&#8221; to spoon feed them instantly gratifying and grossly simplified answers to their questions.</p>
<p>Before I close this journal entry, I would like to posit that it is possible that a large number of people (if not all people) have already been installed with brain-to-computer augmentation without their knowledge and consent (and such that they have no memory of the installation procedure). It is possible that varying levels of access to &#8220;telepathy telephone groups&#8221; exist for different kinds of social organizations. I may be the butt of a large-scale joke in which I am the last human on the planet to be informed of such matters, but I doubt it. I just as well might be the first.</p>
